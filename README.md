# sdk-seven runtime

This repository provides all the low-level components necessary to build ELF
executables and ROMs for the Game Boy Advance. It forms a replacement for
devkitARM's runtime and tooling.

Nintendo DS support is planned in future.

Currently supports C/C++ and Rust, as well as cartridge and multiboot targets.
